#Interviewing Humans


*Have you put any of the advice in the article into practice already? What worked? What could have been better?*

__I was succesfull in having the 3 act structure with my interviews, even though I did not do this intentionally.  There was some casual small talk during the introduction, open ended questions through out the body of the interview with improvised follow up questions when needed and a friendly end to the conversation once I had the information I desired.  I also made sure I didn’t make myself the focus of the interview by talking too much.__  

__The thing I probably could have done better was the briefing of the interviewees.  I told them it would be recorded and it was for a project I’m doing about social networks.  Perhaps it would have been better if I explained in some more detail what the project was about so they could have preemptively thought about the issues before the interview.__



*In your experience, what's most challenging about interviewing people?*

__The most challenging part for me was getting the interviewees to realise that it was ok to stop and think about what they were saying.  I understand that the interviews were being recorded and there would be dead air but I’d be the only person listening to the recordings when I transcribed the interviews.  Although I told them this they still seemed to want to answer the questions quickly, perhaps to come across more intelligent?  Each interviewee seemed a little embarrassed if they could not give a well structured and thought out answer immediately.  I repeatedly said to take their time when answering but their were still some giggles fro participants as they knew there would be silence on the recording.__ 

*Anything that surprised you?*

__I only interviewed 2 people and I was really surprised that the answers they gave where almost completely opposite from each other.  I did not pick two participants that would have polar opposite opinions it just turned out that way.__

*What did you do with the data that you collected during the interviews?*

__With the data I collected I now have a clearer idea of what I want my social network to be like.  It should be simple to use but still have an eye pleasing design.  It also made me aware that a focus on the type of community my network has is really important.  I need to try and create a community of people that will not hinder the network by spamming users with invites to things or generally not being nice people (big meanies!).__
