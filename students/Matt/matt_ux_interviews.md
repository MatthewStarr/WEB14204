#Matt’s wonderful UX Interviews!

__Zoe’s Interview__

Interviewer: Could you say your name and age into the recorder please?

Zoe: Zoe… 20

I: OK

Z: 20...sorry

*_I: Small audible laugh_*

I: Which social networking sites do you use?

Z: Um… Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn, Instagram, Snapchat there are probably other ones that exist that I’m a part of

I: But there the only ones you use regularly?

Z: Yes, regularly scratch Facebook cos I fucking hate that shit

I: Why do you use these?

Z: Um, for various reasons.

I: You can take as much time to think about it

Z: I use facebook because people i know in my life are still on it which is annoying and you organise events on it which is annoying and people i know still use it.  I use Twitter because i have a professional profile on there which employers check so i make sure i try and tweet like i’m an interesting person.  I use instagram because i like posting pictures of boring things, I use snapchat because i like posting pictures of boring things.  I use tumblr because i like reblogging pictures of pretty people and...

*_I: audible laugh_*

*_Z: audible laugh_*

Z: ok scratch that one 

Z: I use tumblr because it’s a good source for feminist issues and you can reblog stuff about feminism and spread the message and find out about things you wouldn’t normally find out about in traditional news sources.

I: and the pretty people

Z: and the pretty people of course

Z: oh i also use linkedin because its a professional profile and i can find out if i’m having an interview or whos going to be interviewing me, i can see who has connections in places i want to work.

I: how often do you use these sites?

Z: I would say there is a core section of them that i use daily because i have the apps downloaded on my phone.  So that would be instagram, tumblr and snapchat and twitter to a certain extent. Facebook and linkedin i’d say are more occasional use usually because i’m going on it either because i haven’t been on it for a while or theres a specific reason i want to go on there.

I: you kind of went on it a bit, how do you access the sites? phone, computer tablet?

Z: the ones i use regularly i have downloaded as an app on my phone, but most of them i can access through a computer.  I also have desktop application for twitter which i sometimes use.  I think that’s it

I: what are some of your favourite features of these social networks?

Z: i like snapchat because you can build up these stories of your days and it doesn’t matter if its a crap photo or not because it is a disposable thing and also you can add text and pictures to it which i enjoy and plus i like seeing other peoples...

*_phone buzz_*

Z: what time is it? I’ll reply to him later

Z: instagram i like because you have to be a bit more artistic with it but its still people sharing photos and i’ve got good friends on there, i persuaded my mum to go on there which is quite funny.  She posts pictures of my dog!

I: Wow

Z: she posts pictures of my dog why wouldn’t you want that on instagram its great
I: and like loads of selfies

Z: yeah mum does selfies, proper pro selfies. shh you’re supposed to be a stranger

*_I: audible laugh_*

*_Z: audible laugh_*

Z: cut that bit

Z: tumblr i like because you can get so many different opinions and you can get news stories and sources with different opinions on it and it’s got it’s own sense of humour and things like that which i quite enjoy.  Plus i think i have time for it now which i didn’t have before, such a waste of time.  Twitter i like because again you can find out news stories, i follow a lot of tech related accounts and i get alerted to things i otherwise wouldn’t be aware of.  facebook i don’t enjoy looking at at all.  linkedin is the same its really tedious but its a necessary evil both of them.

Z: i just need to reach for my tea

I: are there any features you think these social networks need?

*_Z: audible tea slurp_*

Z: facebook better privacy and easier way to delete content. so deleting posts of a certain age would be really useful feature or just deleting the app apparently is what i need to do but you know its one of those things. snapchat there is some really poorly implemented features on it so you can technically chat to people and video chat to people on snaphat its just really poorly done so no one really knows you can do it or have tried and thought really what the hell is this.  so its not done well.  

*_audible plane noise_*

Z: instagram… i don’t know instagrams perfect

*_I: audible laugh_*

*_Z: audible laugh_*

Z: apart from the people on it… and all the products that have popped up around it. no, im not sure with instagram, it is what it is. got to keep it simple really , if they made it convoluted it wouldn’t work.  tumblr, there is a lot of people that need help on that site.  i’m sorry but some people just… well i suppose some of them are seeing therapists, oh god this is on recording.

I: i’m thinking more of the site not necessarily the people on it

Z: tumblr has a terrible mobile app, because its a very image heavy site so it requires a delicate balance to make sure you don’t overload the phone otherwise it will just crash or won’t load the images at all. tumblr hasn’t managed that, it just crashes and is terrible and it doesn’t load things and its very limited experience compared to the website which is not a good thing.  

I: does the site functionality and design of a social network matter to you?

Z: yes because isn’t that basically what it is? if its designed and functioned in a way that its not supposed to function then thats not what it is

I: i’m talking more about, say it works but its kind of clunky  or kind of hard to use

Z: in which case it does matter because ive got no patience for clunky rubbish websites, i just don’t, unless i have to do it like something related to the government but you know unless you have to fill out that form, i don’t want to be on a badly built website because user experience is so important and so many sites get it wrong and i’m not gonna sit around for however long waiting for it to load or to not work or to look like its working but not really work.

I: what makes you join a social network?

Z: i’ll join social networks if… tends to be if someone else has talked about it or someone else has advocated for it because it’s kind of not a social network unless other people are on it and if other people have said its a good thing then that’s kind of how i end up, yeah cos another social network i ended up joining is called Ello or something and it was going to be an ad free facebook and that shit but its boring as hell, but i heard good things about it so i was like ok. i spent no time on it

I: is this the sort of thing that someone you know in real life would have to be like its really good or…

Z: i would probably, i definitely heard about Ello through the internet people and people on other social networks saying hey we’re all going over there now, yeah really? But i do hear about certainly tumblr i was hearing people speak about it way before i actually bothered joining.

I: but would the fact that a family member or a frend said you should join be a defining kind of moment for wanting to do it?

Z: it probably, i think it wouldn’t be like you wanna join? it would be more this is really useful for this or hey i use it for this and things like that.  If i heard someone saying you could use pinterest to do that idea you just talked about i’d be like ok that makes sense to me.

I: would you use a social network for a specific interest of yours? like films or sports?

Z: does imdb count as a social network it does have a social aspect to it and thats very specific.

I: ok, lets say you’re into origami or something…

Z:yeah, something crazy like that

I: would you use a social network based around people liking origami?

Z: i’ve been on forums surrounding origami, which would be a social element but an actual social network.  I guess the beauty of larger social networks is that if you want to you can make it about one thing but there is a way to do that, you know with twitter you can follow people around a topic, with tumblr you can definitely only follow people around a certain topic and make your blog all about a certain topic.  Perhaps going on a site that is specifically for something, i’m not sure if i would go on a site that is for one specific thing because you never know when you’ll get bored of that thing and then where are you left with.

I: would you be interested in being an active member of an online community?

Z: well i suppose if i was joining one it would be during the point of my interest in it and i would join in order to take part and contribute.  otherwise what’s the point in joining, but i suppose you can stalk other peoples responses and answers to things and thats equally a part of contributing to social networks or not, its just stalking them.

I: could anything be done to convince you to maybe use a more niche social network? like if a friend of yours was on it?

Z: I think if the friend was in the same interest sphere and know i was into it as well then yeah that would make a difference 

I: so if a friend of yours was like you gotta join this origami social netwrok its legit cool would you be like i’ve gotta get on that?

Z: yeah, hell yeah, but because they’ve vouched for it and things like that

I: and finally who is your favourite interviewer?

Z: really? i dont even know you man you just showed up in the middle of the street and started asking these questions about origami

I: yeah… but… but still, i think we’ve bonded over this 13 minutes and 55 seconds

Z: do you want me to resay any bits or clarify any bits better or if there is anything i’ve put in a garbled senten…

__Angela’s Interview__

*_Ambient Coffee shop music/ background noise_*

Interviewer: could you say your name and age into the recorder please?

Angela: Angela Inconis, 20 years old

I: which social networking sites do you use?

A: facebook and.... that’s it i think

I: i know for a fact you use snapchat

A: what?

I: you use snapchat don’t you? 

A: no i don’t…

I: oh shit that’s not you then

I: instagram, twitter, linkedin?

A: no i know them i just haven’t got them

I: you only use facebook...ok

I: how do you use it...phone?

A: um…

I: no sorry not… why do you use it?

A: why do i use it? to check what my friends are doing and for me it works differently because i’m outside home at this moment so its good to see what my friends are doing since i’m not there.  and also to talk to them because it would be difficult if i didn’t have facebook i wouldn’t be able to chat to them and other stuff. and also i use messenger a lot on facebook to phone call my friends and my parents back in my home country.

I: where’s your home country?

A: italy

I: what part?

A: sorry i didn’t say that… I’m from Sardinia 

I: how often do you use these sites?

A: i don’t know like everyday, a lot. i dont know

I: a few hours? a couple minutes?

A: it depends on the day, i guess its bad

I: on average?

A: on average, i dunno, one hour per day, one hour and a half. like on average

I: how do you access these sites? on your phone on your computer?

A: my phone and my computer, but you know they always have something to catch you, like videos and stuff, i also use it for that. just to laugh at videos

I: would you say you use, go on it more on your phone while you’re out and about…

A: i go on it more on my phone

I: what’s your favourite features of facebook?

A: my favourite feature?

I: yeah… what do you like about it. what does the site offer that you like?

A: seriously i don’t know…

I: well you said earlier about the messenger

A: yeah of course i love that cos its fast and you can actually, i don’t know everything is there, everyone is always there. there are lots of things that i don’t like more than i do like

I: are there any features you think this social network should have?  so...what don’t you like about it?

A: i don’t like the like button for sure, no just kidding

*_I: audible laugh_*

A: don’t know seriously about this… i don’t know what kind of features. wait i have to think about this

I: take as much time as you like

A: what can facebook have? um…

I: its perfect as it is!

A: its not perfect but i mean…

I: ok what’s not good about it?

A: ok you should block the requesting for play with this guy blah blah help me play this game, you should be able to block that because they’re really annoying and actually i think they’re improving a lot because before there were a lot things that were not good but now there are a few.

A: does the design and functionality of the site effect, if it was poorly designed would you not use it as much?

A: i think that design is important of course, i think it is because its more attractive

I: you said you use it to connect to people back in italy so even if it was clunky and didn’t work very well would you still use it?

A: no of course, you get waiting a lot of time before, i dunno, a message is sent or something like that so of course not 

I: but you prefer it as quite aesthetically pleasing?

A: what’d you mean?

I: it looks nice

A: yeah it looks nice but i remember when all the people were complaining when they changed the design of the chat. it took quite a bit of time before that was improved so i think you just have to get used to it

I: what makes you join a social network?

A: what makes me join? sorry i don’t know what you mean… why do i go there? 

I: if someone was advertising a social network to you what we be like i need to join this…

A: i would be more drawn, is that right drawn by my friend

I: ok so you’re more drawn if your friends on it

A: yeah if i see a lot of friends that are there i think there is a reason why i should be there because if there is no one i know what’s the point of being there you know? thats why i don’t use Viber actually cos a lot of friends of mine dont have it

I: Viber?

A: viber, its like whatsapp or something like that. its not a social thing i think. but i think you have to have a lot of friends there i think and they tell you look at this look at this, thats what happend with facebook because i wasn’t there and my friends told me that i should

I: ok, would you use a social network for a specific interest of yours?

A: yes

I: so say would you join one specifically for films?

A: yes definitely because i actually found a lot of people from my uni before going there just looking for, do you mean this stuff? cos you’re looking at me like…

I: huh...

A: do you mean this stuff that i’m answering you?

I: what do you mean do i mean the stuff?

A: the answer, are you looking for…

I: i dunno you were half way through explaining what the answer was

A: ok i mean i think its really useful because i have a project or something i just have to find people that have my same interest and go into groups and this stuff and i find them and it’s useful to work.  in this moment i know a lot of people are going out of facebook but i can’t because for me its useful for working because every advice from my teachers is there, you know i get organised through groups and chat with different groups to do some projects so its easier cos even if you don’t have their numbers you have there facebook contact so just find them there and you organise 

I: but if there’s a whole new social network just about films or another interest within your life would you join that?

A: yes

I: you would, even if none of your friends are on it?

A: yes because…

I: if i said to you heres a thing about films its really cool and you’d go and do it?

A: yes if its about an interest i’ve got well then yeah absolutely

I: would you, do you think you’d be an active member on that sort of thing? would you go on it a lot and talk to a lot of people on it? join the community that’s there? 

A: i don’t know if…

*_Barista: audible italian speaking_*

*_A: audible italian speaking_*

I: stop flirting! audible laugh

A: i’m not flirting, jesus christ. its not flirting

I: Angela’s flirting!

A: its not flirting

*_I: audible laugh_*

A: you never saw me flirting so

I: i don’t know what he just said in italian

A: oh we were talking in, he just saying was it good coffee. so anyway

I: what was the question again?

A: would you be an active member?

*_I: audible laugh_*

A: it depends on the, on how much, how interesting is the website. is the website like facebook now where you can share a lot of things see a lot of videos and i don’t know its active now so it will push you to do things actually, so i think i would be an active member

I: so lets say they’re having an in depth discussion about hitchcock films or the latest, what’s on the cinema right now or whatever, would you be like oh yeah i wanna join in on the conversation

A: i think i would be more one that would read the conversation instead of join in maybe

I: could anything be done to convince you to join in more, say like a friend of yours was on the site as well and your saw them chatting to these people would you then sort of join in?

A: maybe i would join the thing if i see that there is something that really annoys me...

*_I: audible laugh_*

A: like they’re saying somthing im not, i don’t, how do you say that 

I: agree with?

A: yeah, thanks, i don’t agree with what they’re saying because they’re completely saying, can i say bullshit?, if they’re completely saying bullshit yes i would then comment but otherwise…

I: so only if they said something you were passionately against?

A: not for something i agree i would just put a like or something like that

I: would you say that you like having a feature where you can just click to like something then?

A: yes definitely

I: final question, who is your favourite interviewer?

*_A: audible laugh_*

A: well i have to think about it, i think it’s, uh… it’s you and david lettermen is after you

I: Woohoo!

A: did you really put this question?
