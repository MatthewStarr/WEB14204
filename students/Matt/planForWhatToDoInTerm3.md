#Matt's ultimate plan to make something that kicks ass based on what everyone said at the formative!

__You shouldn't care what other people think of you?__

*Shut up hippie and make a gosh darn plan based on what people think of you!*

__Calm down buddy, I'll make a plan.  Geez!__


1. Do a lot more research into target audience, really find out what they want from a site like this.
2. Do further research of competitiors websites, including astrology dating sites.
3. For the compatability page add a further function for dating options, maybe not a main feature of the site but still there if people want it.
4. Work on the design of the site (make it real pwetty!)
5. Think of what to call the 'like' button
6. Script the copy for sign up and make sure people know what features they will get after the initial birth chart
7. Get some user feedback from people who have used the site (interactive wireframes)
8. Do more changes based on what they said!
