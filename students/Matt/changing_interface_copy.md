#Changing Interface Copy

__I created two new variations of the interface copy for my social networks Horoscope page__

__I decided to put two tests on usability hub where each new variation would be put against the original copy and see which people would prefer__

__Each test had 20 responses__

__The first variation changed the copy by making everything really vague__
__Out of 20 responses 5 people actually prefered the really vague version of the copy.  The average time to pick this option was 14 seconds so they had actually given both versions a good look before deciding__

__The second variation I decided to change every word with a similar word that the thesaurus provided.  This made the copy somewhat difficult too understand but not impossible.  Out of the 20 responses only 3 people prefered the second variation and those people had spent an average of 41 seconds to decide that actually liked it more!__

__This would prove that the original copy I had provided which was simple, friendly and straight forward was already good for the interface of my social network.  Although I did discover that a higher percentage than I expected prefered the somewhat confussing and more out there copy.__
