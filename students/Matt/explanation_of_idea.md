#Matt's incredible idea for a niche social network

__Who is it for?__

*My social network is for those interested in astrology, whether that be an enthusiasts level or just someone who is interested in learning a little bit about it.  That being said the prodiminant users would most likely be those somewhat knowledgeable or interested in the subject.*

__How does it work?__

*The social network has many features.  As soon as the user signes up they create their own personalised birth chart which also tells them about their sun sign, moon sign, birth stone, numerology number etc.  There is also a horoscopes page, Daily topics forum, compatibility element which shows the other site users you would compatible according to your birth charts.  This feature may also expand into a dating function but that is still a new idea.*

__What is unique about it?__

*Although there are many sites to do with astrology they all fall into 3 categories.  A general forum with questions about star signs amongst the other topics, an information website and dating sites.  My social network combines elements of all 3 of these but also allows people to just become friends easily with other users which obviously share an interest in astrology.*

__Where are you currently in the design process?__

*Currently I am wire framing and user testing.  I am starting to produce actual designs for the website and the interface copy the site should have.*
