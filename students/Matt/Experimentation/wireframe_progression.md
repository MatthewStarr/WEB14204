#Wireframe Progression

<h3>Initial Wireframe</h3>
Here are a few sketches I did just to get my initial ideas down. Through out the entire wireframing process the basic design for my social network has remained similar.

<h3>Secondary Wireframes</h3>

 Here are my first digital wireframes.  They are pretty similar to the ones I sketched as this step was all about getting my ideas onto a digital platform.

<h3>Desktop Wireframes</h3>

For this step I adapted the designs for desktop as I originally planned on creating a mobile and desktop version of the social network.  Due to timing issues I only produced a mobile prototype. All of the information for the desktop version was the same and when I did a test on Usability Hub the results declared that people understood the product was about astrology.

<h3>Initial Prototype</h3>

After testing the desktop version and receiving positive feedback I started work on the prototype in its most developed form. I chose to focus on mobile as the brief specified to do so.  For this step I took the basic concept from the previous wireframes and fleshed them out so it looked like a legitimate product.  I added proper information and features needed for a successful product (Star, comment, Report buttons etc).  

Here are some of the wireframes I created at this stage.

I uploaded these to InVision and linked the pages togehter.  This was my second interactive prototype but the first one that had some proper user testing.  I had five people come and use the app and noted down their opinions.

<h3>Final Prototype</h3>

After receiving the feedback from the user testing session I realised I had many changes to make.


Here is a quick explanation of the changes I made.
