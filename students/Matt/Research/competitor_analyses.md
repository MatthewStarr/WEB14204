#Competitor Analyses

When I decided I wanted my social network to be about astrology I looked into other sites around the subject.  I found relatively quickly that sites to do with astrology are either quite old or really disgusting to look at.  I also found out that there aren't really any social networks based on astrology.

There are lots of astrology forums but these were not designed for people to really build a community on.  Users are able to talk with each other but it is only as strangers and once the conversation is over that is it, it's over!  Some forums did have the ability for people to add each other as friends but the feature did not seem well used or incorporated into the site.  With my network I would have to put a real push towards community.

*Here are two of the forums I looked at:*

As well as forums there are some astrology based dating services.  These suffer the same problem but from a different perspective.  These were designed for people to meet each other in the hope of a romantic connection.  So communities cannot be built here either because users only meet a few people, possibly just one if you're lucky!  I did discover by looking through some of the users dating profiles that there is a large and massively diverse group of people interested in astrology.

*Here are some of the dating sites I looked at:*

After doing this research I am confident that there is a gap for an astrology social network because I can find large groups of people interested in the subject but no platform for them to converse about it and create a community together.  Also all the sites I looked at were really poorly designed, to the point where whatever I design will look better then they do.
