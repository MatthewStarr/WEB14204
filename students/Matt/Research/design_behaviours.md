#Design Behaviours

**Analysis of Optimism Bias**

People are generally slightly more optimistic about things.
This is bad when you have to think about everything that could go wrong in a project.

We can all learn from this.  If you expect the most dimwitted person ever is going to use your app and design it so even they can use it easily then itâ€™ll be a success.



**How I'll incorporate design behaviours**

I'll be incorporating a specific design behaviour into my signing up process.  Instead of having a form with several boxes to fill, I will be using the method of giving the user one box to fill at a time.  By having one box to fill per page the user feels as if they are putting in less effort then looking at it all at once.  I decided to use this method as I would tie it in with the astrology theme by getting the persons information and producing them their personal birth chart, whilst at the same time registering them to the network.
