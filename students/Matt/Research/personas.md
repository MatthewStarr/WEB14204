After talking about astrology with someone at a party he has learned astrology is not exactly what he thought and now he is interested in learning more about it.


**Persona 2**

Name: Abbi

Goal: Meet people she can share her interests with

Attitude: Believer

Abbi has been interested in astrology since she was 12.  She is an introverted girl who lives in a small town and doesn’t have many friends.  She doesn’t know anyone who likes astrology and although her parents will listen to her talk about it they do not actively engage in the subject.  She has been on astrology forums and enjoys discussing topics but wishes to have deeper conversations with some of the people she meets online.
